# In the first week of Term

There are several things you'll need to do at the start of the course to get set up with all the technology, accounts, and services we'll be using.
I've split these tasks up into several chunks so it's a bit more manageable. 

```{dropdown} 6. Complete the first Learning Log (LL01) on Gradescope.

This assignment will help you get familiar with answering questions on Gradescope, some of its features, and how you can access feedback on your learning logs.
```

```{dropdown} 7. Complete your first Homework (HW01) PrairieLearn.
    :class-container: sd-shadow-lg
    :color: primary
    :open:

This assignment will help you get familiar with answering questions on the PrairieLearn platform.
We will be using this platform for our weekly homework assignments as well as the Tests.
```

```{dropdown} 8. Get Familiar with the course pattern.

It is my intention to establish a "course pattern" where the only thing that changes from week-to-week is the specific content we're learning that week.
Otherwise, the pattern of videos, homework, class activities, tests, etc. will remain the same.
Go through the "Sample Week" on the course website to get familiar with the course pattern, and some motivation for why we are doing things this way.
