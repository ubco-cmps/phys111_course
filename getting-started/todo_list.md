Things to do at the start of the course
=======================

There are several things you'll need to do at the start of the course to get set up with all the technology, accounts, and services we'll be using.
I've split these tasks up into several chunks so it's a bit more manageable. 
In the first chunk (Before the first class) are the same four things that you received through a Canvas Announcement.

```{dropdown} <h3>Before the first class</h3>

<label><input type="checkbox" id="todo1-1" class="box"> **1) Make sure you have the textbook!**  </input></label> 

You'll need it to get through the course, and do all the homework assignments using the online system. 

My MasteringPhysics course ID is: **moosvi87376**. [Here is a PDF from Pearson](https://firas.moosvi.com/courses/physics111/Student_Registration_Handout_moosvi87376.pdf) that walks you the steps to get onto the platform. 

<label><input type="checkbox" id="todo1-2" class="box"> **2. Have a look at the syllabus.** </input></label> 

It is now live on Canvas under the "Course Content" sidebar item. You can also [view it outside of Canvas here](https://firas.moosvi.com/courses/physics111).

<label><input type="checkbox" id="todo1-3" class="box"> **3) Annotate the Syllabus.** </input></label> 

I want to know what you think of the syllabus! Yes, I want your thoughts, feedback, and opinions on how you want the course to go this term. If one of you has a good idea for a change, adjustment or addition - I'd love to adopt it if it fits with the course. I strongly believe that you are now in charge of your own education, and I am just a guide to help point you in the right direction. 

How should you annotate the syllabus? Well there's a really awesome tool called hypothes.is - when enabled, it allows anyone to highlight and comment on any website. I have turned this feature on for our course website. This is an experiment, and I encourage you to make comments and highlights on our syllabus. Let's see how it goes! Don't be shy, but please be respectful and courteous.

Here's what you need to do:

First click this link and Sign Up for Hypothes.is when it asks you to log in: https://hypothes.is/groups/o9PDYB4E/physics111-students.

Next, go back to the Syllabus website (in Canvas or on the web) and click the "<" button at the right of the webpage.

<label><input type="checkbox" id="todo1-4" class="box"> **4) [Optional] Sign up for the unofficial UBCO 1st Year Science Discord Server** </input></label> 

Some of your first year instructors have banded together to create a Discord server where students can chat with each other, share stories and experiences (or funny TikTok videos), and interact with each other. This is essentially a glorified (and more organized) instant messaging service - some of you may already be on other Discords (if you are, I might ask you to help moderate). In this online environment, we believe this is our best change of maintaining some level of human interaction.

You are not certainly not required to sign up for this service as the data is not hosted on Canadian servers, but if you like, you can sign up for the Discord server with this invitation link: https://discord.gg/uzcEBSK.
