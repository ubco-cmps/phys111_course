Final Exam Information
=======================

Hi all,

The moment you've all been waiting for: final exam details.

Here is what I can tell you now.

The final exam will: 

- be conducted on Canvas (most likely).
- be scheduled and a sit-down exam where you join a CU or Zoom session.
- have the same rules as Tests (but no test window).
- include multiple choice questions (similar to Tests).
- include short answer questions (similar to Test & Practice Qs).
- require you to solve some problems with symbols/algebra.
- NOT include questions on deriving formulas.
- have some choice in which problems you choose to complete.
