## Practice Problems

We have put together some additional practice problems to help you complete the homework.
These problems are optional, and suggested if you are having trouble with the homework problems.
The odd-numbered problems from the textbook should have solutions available to students.

- Q65: Parallel axis theorem and moment of inertia
- Q73: Torque
- Q77: Torque
- Q89: Torque, angular acceleration, and moment of inertia (Newton's second low for rotation)
- Q99: Work and Power for rotational motion.
- Q121 (Challenge problems): Angular acceleration/ position, linear velocity

### Chapter 11

- Q35: Angular momentum
- Q37: Angular momentum with unit vectors
