# Homework

There are no more homeworks, you're done!

```{tip}
Remember: Your score on Homework assignments will never go down! Once you earn a score, you can regenerate new variants for practice. Even if you don't get those practice questions correct, you will still keep your original score! You are highly encouraged to continue practising old HW questions in preparation for the final exam.
