Week 0 Summary
=======================

## Introduction 

Welcome to my class! 
I want all my students to know **exactly** what to expect in a given week.
So even before the course starts, I have created a "sample" week with some fake content so you can get a sense of how this course will go.

## Course flow (Schemtic)

Sample plan for an "ideal" week (i.e. if everything goes according to plan) for one of my courses. Note especially that there isn't just one day dedicated for this class but rather, the work is distributed across multiple days. This may seem counter-intuitive, but there is literature that very clearly shows that multiple study sessions are more beneficial for learning and for test performance than single isolated study sessions.
Real life will be a lot messier than this! Life may throw up obstacles and barriers, or other courses will get in the way - that's fine. The most important thing you should extract from this schematic is that itâ€™s very important to split up your efforts over multiple sessions!

## List of things to do this week

Below is a list of things you need to do this week, links to where you can do them, as well as roughly the order you should do it.
Note that these are just SUGGESTIONS and you are by no means required to them this way. 
I have put the labs at the end, but if your lab section is earlier in the week, you may want to shift things around to accommodate that.
