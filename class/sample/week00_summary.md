Week 0 Summary
=======================

## Introduction 

Welcome to my class! 
I want all my students to know **exactly** what to expect in a given week.
So even before the course starts, I have created a "sample" week with some fake content so you can get a sense of how this course will go.

## List of things to do this week

Below is a list of things you need to do this week, links to where you can do them, as well as roughly the order you should do it.
Note that these are just SUGGESTIONS and you are by no means required to them this way. 
I have put the labs at the end, but if your lab section is earlier in the week, you may want to shift things around to accommodate that.
