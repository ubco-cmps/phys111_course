### "Who's in class" survey

Hello! And welcome to my class.

It is important to me that the welcome above, is not just words. I strive to make all of my classes as inclusive as possible given my time and workload constraints. There is always room to improve. To try and focus some of my energies, I'd like to collect some data about who is in my class, so I can try to make some more targeted adjustments and improvements.

This form gives you the opportunity to share aspects of your social identity and other attributes that can help your instructor know how to better support overall learning in this course.

The information collected will be used to help foster an inclusive and equitable classroom and is completely anonymous, and optional.

Please be aware, it is not required for you to complete this form, and that you are not obligated in any way to complete this! There is no extra credit, or penalties associated with completing or not completing the form.

Note: If you are enrolled in multiple classes with me, you may want to fill this out multiple times because your answers may be different depending on the class you're taking!
