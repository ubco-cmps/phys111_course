# Test 0

````{panels}

This week is your first test - it is NOT for marks, but is not optional.
It is a Math diagnostic to see what your current math knowledge is.
You do not need to study, and you should not use any external or outside sources, do your best with what you know at this moment.
If you don't know the answer to a question, just select "I don't know" - there will be several questions you do not yet know the answer to based on integration and differentiation (and that's fine, you will learn it in Math 100).
It will also give you practice on how the testing system works.
