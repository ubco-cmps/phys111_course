Week 1
=======================

This week we will be doing course introductions, I will be showing you how to navigate the course website, and how the course is set up. 
In terms of content, we will use this week to do a math diagnostic, get everyone access to the textbook and homework system, and understand the syllabus.

## List of things to do this week

Below is a list of things you need to do this week, links to where you can do them, as well as roughly the order you should do it.
Note that these are just SUGGESTIONS and you are by no means required to them this way. 
I have put the labs at the end, but if your lab section is earlier in the week, you may want to shift things around.
