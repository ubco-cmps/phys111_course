There are usually lab or tutorial exemptions for some students (i.e. those repeating the course) and instructions for that will be in this syllabus.
```

### What do I need to purchase for this course?

Being very conscious of the high tuition and technology costs, we have made efforts to remove the additional cost of taking this course.
All course content, references, and resources provided in this course are free and open source, and can be considered open educational resources (OER).

The best way to get personalized help in this course is to attend the "Student Hours" we have scheduled for this course.
They are all done on Zoom and this is time that the instructor and TAs have set aside to help YOU personally, 1 on 1!
I understand it might feel intimidating to come to Student Hours, but we don't bite!
We would love to hear about you, what your interests are, and if you have any career advice. 
If nobody comes to the Student Hours, we end up sitting in a Zoom room all by ourselves, all alone, and sad.

A few other notes:

- We will be using {{ FORUM_LINK }} for Announcements in this course.
- For **all** course-related questions you can reach out to the teaching team including instructors and TAs via {{ FORUM_LINK }}.
- You are encouraged to post questions publicly whenever possible so others can benefit. For private and personal issues, you can send private messages on {{ FORUM_LINK }}.
- Any student may visit the student hour for any member of the teaching team (TA or instructor)! In other words, you can go to the student hour of ANY TA, not just the one whose lab/tutorial you are registered in. 

### A message from your instructor

Will add a video message here soon.

<!-- Closer to the start of the term, I will update the video below with an actual message to the students :-).
Until then, enjoy being [Rick-Rolled](https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/rickrolling/).

## Unsyllabus changes

In this section, I will outline any changes that have been made to the unsyllabus as we go through the course.
We will do our best to follow the plan outlined in this unsyllabus, but in case things go south, I will need to make adjustments to the contents and the schedule.

Any major changes to the syllabus (this page) will be documented here, as well as the date the change was made. 

| Change Date | Summary                                                           | Rationale                                                    |

## How do I do well in this course? 

For full details, please see the page {ref}`page_doing_well`.

To whet your appetite on what you'll read there, here are some guidelines on preparing yourselves for this course:

1. Learning is a contact sport.
2. Memorizing is not learning.
3. Understanding is learning and understanding should be your goal.
4. We'll do lots of tests.

And some ingredients for your success:

1. Plan.
1. Prepare.
1. Engage.
1. Practice.
1. Collaborate.
1. Do not be fooled by familiarity of the material.
1. Math.

### ... but I've never been good at physics or math!

That's okay! 
You're still more than welcome in this course.
I will do everything I can (within reason) to still make the course accessible to you.
This course is designed with your success in mind.
There are multiple opportunities for you to learn from your mistakes and improve your grades in nearly every aspect of the course.
In my opinion, the best learning happens when folks are given the opportunity to make mistakes so they get over their fear of trying something!
At the beginning of the term, we will all do a Math Diagnostic (not for marks) to check if you have the required math background for this course. 
If you do not, I have some supplemental material for you to catch up.
My expectation is that you'll complete the exercises and review the supplemental material in the first couple of weeks.

To summarize, if you've never been "good" at physics or math, come into the course with a healthy attitude, a desire to work for your success, and I have no doubt you will be successful in this course. 
If you ever want to talk about the course, or have any feedback you want to give me, do not hesitate to reach out to me!

### ... but I don't even like physics or math!

Believe it or not, I have no expectation that every student that takes my course will have an undying passion for the subject.
Some of you may be forced to take this course by your programs, faculties, career interests, etc...
Sometimes we all have to take courses that we think we don't like, or enjoy. 
That's fine!
No judgement from me, you are more than welcome in this course.
I just ask that you not make any snap judgements about the class, the material, the instructor (me), or the teaching team.
Whatever your motivations are for taking this course, give us a chance, maybe you don't HAVE TO be miserable taking this course!
You might even enjoy the feeling of community and camaraderie that develops over the course of the semester :-). 

I hope you're not miserable, if you do feel miserable, come talk to me - maybe I can help you see the light at the end of tunnel?

## Course Tools

There is no cost to the student for any of the tools used in this course.

### Required Tools

In this course, we will be using the following required learning technologies (privacy policies linked): 

- [Canvas](https://faculty.canvas.ubc.ca/canvas-privacy/)
- [Ed Discussion](https://edstem.org/privacy)
- [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/privacy)
- PrairieLearn (Not Available)

All tools used in the course will be used in a [FIPPA-compliant](https://universitycounsel.ubc.ca/subject-areas/access-and-privacy-general/access-to-information/about-fippa/) manner, with your privacy top of mind. 
New tools may be added to the course as the need arises, and I will update this section with the appropriate information and make an announcement if a new tool is added midway through a course.

```{warning}
Even though the tools above are required for this course, if you have a moral or legal objection to my use of these tools, please do reach out to me and we can likely find an acceptable accommodation.
```

### Sign up for a (free) Ed Discussion account [Required]

In this course, we will be using {{ FORUM_LINK }} for class discussions.
The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TA, and myself.
Please do NOT email questions to the instructor and TAs unless it is a legitimate emergency (or if you cannot access Ed Discussion).

```{warning}
The Ed Discussion tool is stored on servers outside Canada. When you access this site by clicking on the link through Canvas, you are being transferred to these servers. In order to protect your identity, UBC obfuscates your user ID before it is sent to the site. However, Ed Discussion does require you to create an account on their servers. While Ed Discussion adheres to strict U.S. privacy regulations (FERPA), UBC cannot guarantee security of your private details on servers outside of Canada. Please exercise caution whenever using personal information. You may wish to use a pseudonym to protect your privacy if you have concerns.
```

Sign up for {{ FORUM_LINK }} using our unique course link.

### What type of information will I collect about you in this course?

Having taught [DSCI 541: Privacy, Ethics, and Security](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI_541_priv-eth-sec) in the UBC Master of Data Science in the past, I am very aware of the surveillance culture that has permeated our society and heralded the [End of Privacy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesTWiKfpD0) as we know it.
That being said, as an instructor, I care tremendously about your learning and the course-related data that is collected about you is extremely valuable. 
Broadly speaking, this relatively new field is called **Learning Analytics**.
[Learning Analytics](https://www.solaresearch.org/about/what-is-learning-analytics/) involves the collection and analysis of data about learners for the [express purpose](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/the-express-purpose-of) of improving their learning by optimizing teaching and learning practices.

All of the tools above log data about your activity that can be used to improve the quality of teaching and learning.
In this course, I intend to use this information to:

- view overall class progress (in aggregate),
- track your personal progress in order to provide you with personalized feedback,
- track participation in discussion forums
- improve the course and your learning, 
- explore students actions in the course, 
- provide you feedback on your progress.

Unfortunately, at the moment it is not possible to opt-out of the data collection process, but if you like, you may opt-out of the process where *I use the data to give you personalized feedback*. 
To opt-out, please {{ ANALYTICS_OPTOUT }} at any point in the course. 
You may opt-out with my full support, I respect your decision and applaud you for your netizenship!

## Teaching Philosophy

For a detailed description of my teaching philosophy and values (including a list of references and citations), you can [read it here](https://firas.moosvi.com/cv/teaching-philosophy/).
Here are the key principles I intend to apply in this class:

1. Student learning is vastly improved through active learning
1. Learning technologies must be leveraged to scale instructor effort across multiple classes.
1. Inter-disciplinarity is the future of education.
1. Effective teaching is inclusive teaching.

### How will this course be taught ?

This course will be taught as a [Blended Learning classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blended_learning) where some elements of a [flipped classroom](https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BCIxikOq73Q) will be mixed with a more traditional coding classroom with live demos, clicker questions, and worksheets.
Briefly, this requires students to watch videos and engage with the assigned reading prior to the classroom meeting (knowledge transfer).
During the class meeting, the instructor guides students through clicker questions, worksheet problems, and other activities to help the students make sense of the material (sense-making).
See {numref}`masterymodel1` for a mental model of how learning works {cite}`Ambrose2010`.

```{figure} ../images/masterymodel1.png
---
width: 750px
name: masterymodel1
---
To develop mastery in a concept, students must first acquire the necessary skills, then practice integrating them, and finally know when to apply what they have learned. This figure was adapted from Figure 4.1 of the book "How Learning Works".
The terms "knowledge transfer" and "sense-making" applied in this context is generally attributed to [Dr. Eric Mazur](https://mazur.harvard.edu/files/mazur/files/flip_your_course_online_07.pdf). 
```

### What does this mean in practical terms? 

{numref}`masterymodel2` shows a handy table to help guide you and organize your learning in this course: 

```{figure} ../images/masterymodel2.png

This table describes how I think each course activity should be classified between knowledge transfer and sense-making.
```

## Academic Integrity

### How do I go through this course with integrity?

I want to be proud of your work in this course, and I want YOU to be proud of yourself as well!
That cannot happen if you make unethical decisions, including (but not limited) to cheating or plagiarism.
According to the scientific literature, the most common reasons students cheat are:

- Fear of failure and life consequences
- Peer pressure, including an inability to say no to help others cheat
- Perceived societal acceptance of cheating (Lance Armstrong, Barry Bonds, Enron, Wall Street & the The Big Short)
- Desire for success without the time/desire to put in the work needed
- Strict deadlines and due-dates
- Requirement from instructors to memorize facts, figures, equations, etc...
- High-stakes exams with no recompense for "having a bad day"
- Peers cheating with no consequences or penalties
- Unclear expectations on what constitutes academic dishonesty
- Inadequate support from instructor and teaching team

Though I sympathize with students and the stresses of your busy lives - in my opinion, there is no good reason to cheat.
I have tried extremely hard to make this course focused on learning rather than grading, and where grading is needed, to have policies that are as student-friendly as possible.
In particular, I hope (and expect) that the following features of the course should eliminate your temptation to cheat or plagiarize:

- {{ GRACE_PERIOD }} grace-period on all due dates and deadlines.
- Long testing window so you can start the tests whenever you're comfortable.
- Weekly learning logs, homework and reading reflections to make you think about your learning ([metacognition](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/metacognition/)).
- Each test has a "bonus test" available one week later; for each test, we will take the better score of the pair.
- No high-stakes exams (the single largest assessment item is the final exam).
- All course assessments are completely open book, open notes, and open web (except for cheating websites like Chegg, CourseHero, Slader, Bartleby, etc...)
- Plenty of TA and instructor student hours and several outside of normal business hours.
- Class website that outlines exactly what you should do when to help you manage your time.
- Tonnes of supplemental materials including other instructional videos in case you want a different perspective.
- Weekly prompt to accept the integrity pledge to keep you accountable.
- A true willingness from the instructor (me) to help you learn and succeed in this course!

With these features, and several other little things, I sincerely hope that you will consider completing this course with maximum integrity so that you never have to feel guilty, ashamed, or disappointed in yourself and your actions!

A more detailed description of academic integrity, including the University’s policies and procedures, may be found in the [Academic Calendar](https://calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,0).

### What is considered academic dishonesty in this course?

To make it even easier for you to decide what isn't allowed, below is a list of things that I **definitely** consider to be academic dishonesty:

- Asking others for their work in the course (whether question by question, or all at once)
- Sending others your work in the course
- Doing tests collaboratively (tests **must** be done by yourself and alone)
- Sending others your test questions and/or answers
- Sharing any course material onto Chegg, Course Hero, Slader, or other similar sites
- Searching for solutions to course material on Chegg, Course Hero, Slader, or other similar sites
- Blindly googling the question in hopes of finding someone who had a similar question and then copying their answer
    - Note, googling to find resources to understand specific concepts or general ideas is highly encouraged!
- Having a tutor/friend/nemesis complete and submit your work for you
- Copying and pasting code, equations, text explanations, prose, etc... without attribution
- Manipulating the learning platforms we use to reverse engineer the randomization algorithms, hacking the timer functionality, or other similar technical [malfeasance](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/malfeasance).

## Course Accommodations

### What if I miss labs, tests, or the exam due to an illness, health, or other personal situations?

Normally, most deadlines in this course have a generous grace period.
If you require an extension beyond the grace period, please contact the instructor on {{ FORUM_LINK }} (ideally before the deadline passes) to discuss your options.

Students who, because of unforeseen events, are absent during the term and are unable to complete tests or other graded work, should normally discuss with their instructors how they can make up for missed work.
If ill health is an issue, students are encouraged to seek attention from a health professional.
Campus Health and Counselling will normally provide documentation only to students who have been seen previously at these offices for treatment or counselling specific to conditions associated with their academic difficulties.

```{tip}
If you miss a course component due to an illness, health, or other personal situation, please reach out to me as soon as you are comfortable, and I'll work with you to get you back on track.
```

### What if I have dependents that rely on me for care and unpredictable emergencies may arise?

Let's talk, send me a private message and we can discuss it.
I do not necessarily need to know all the personal details, just a high-level summary of your situation and what you think an ideal solution would be.

I'm sure we will come to some agreement, generally the earlier you let me know of any special circumstances or accommodation, the more I'll be able to do for you!

### What if I have to miss a deadline because of a wedding, birthday, funeral, religious holiday, or personal event ?

No problem! There's not even any need to tell me, or ask for permission to miss deadlines.
The course is designed to give you maximum flexibility: 

- Every deadline has a {{ GRACE_PERIOD }} grace period that is automatically applied.
- There is no late penalty if you use the grace period
- You can use the grace period an unlimited amount of time in the course (though if it happens every week and for every assignment, I might check in with you and gently encourage you not to leave things to the last minute)

```{tip}
Remember, if you miss a Test for whatever reason, you can make it up the following week in the bonus test!
```

If you miss a deadline by more than the grace period, the general course policy is that you will get 0 on it.
In some cases, I reserve the right to grant an extension, or provide an alternate assignment.

### What should I do if I need accommodations to be successful in this course?

Accommodations are intended to remove barriers experienced by individuals with disabilities.
As a matter of principle, UBC is committed to promoting human rights, equity and diversity, and it also has a legal duty under the BC Human Rights Code to make its goods and services available in a manner that does not discriminate.
[Policy 73](https://universitycounsel.ubc.ca/files/2019/02/policy73.pdf) (Accommodation for Students with Disabilities) sets out principles and processes governing the accommodation of students with disabilities.

All accommodations for this course are handled through the [Disability Resource Centre](https://students.ok.ubc.ca/academic-success/disability-resources/contact-the-disability-resource-centre/) and I encourage you to contact them to book an appointment. 

### Compassion

As I'm sure you're aware, *there is (still) a global pandemic* happening right now and we could all use some extra compassion and humanity.
If you're going through something that is affecting you (course or otherwise), you are always welcome to come and talk to me about it. 
If I am not able to help you myself, then I can probably direct you to the right person or resource.
If you need extra help, or extra time to deal with something you're going through, just ask.
You will *never* owe me an explanation about your physical health, mental health, or those of your family members, friends, etc... I will believe you, and I will trust you.
I will not judge you, nor think any less of you.
I will do everything in my power to work out something that is both reasonable and fair. 
This, I promise!

### What should I think about if I'm considering withdrawing from the course?

First of all, I'm sorry you're having trouble and are considering withdrawing from the course!
This is no problem, and I will not be personally offended or upset you need to do this, I encourage you to do what you feel is right for you and your situation. 
Below is some information that might be helpful for you in making the decision.

```{warning} Please note that it is the student's responsibility to check the withdrawal dates as [listed in the UBC Calendar](http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/okanagan/index.cfm?go=deadlines).
