1. Introduce the conceptual framework of classical mechanics and confront any misconceptions you might hold (encouraging “Newtonian” thinking).
2. Explore the power and simplicity of effective model building.
3. Develop the following skills: proportional reasoning, dimensional analysis, physical reasoning, pictorial representations (free-body diagrams), reading for understanding (asking why is this true?), that are critical for every upper year science course. 
4. Develop advanced problem-solving, written and verbalc ommunication skills.
5. Nurture the development of graphical approaches to understanding areas and slopes.
6. Understand and appreciate the crucial role that experiment plays in the scientific method. 
7. Show you that physics is everywhere, and excite you about its relevance to your area of study and life
