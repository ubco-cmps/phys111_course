The grading scheme for this course is:

| Item                | Weight        | Due date(s)                      |
|---------------------|---------------|----------------------------------|
| Learning Logs       | 10% (10 x 1%) | Saturdays at 6 PM                |
| Homework            | 18% (9 x 2%)  | Thursdays at 6 PM                |

| Final Exam (Online) | 20%           | Scheduled During the Exam Period |

There will be 5 tests in this course in an (approximately) bi-weekly schedule.
For each of the tests, there will be a bonus test one week later and the better score of the Test-Bonus Test pair will be taken.

```{caution} 
Please note that the "Labs" in this course are run almost completely separately from the Lectures/Tutorials/Tests/Exams. Any grading policies instituted in the lecture portion of the course are independent of the lab policies.
```

```{attention} 
All deadlines in this course have an automatic 48 hour grace period after the due dates listed above.
Any submissions submitted past the grace period will not be graded (with some exceptions, see below).
```

```{note}
Important: The maximum mark you can get on each item is 100%.

### Other Grading Policies

There is a delicate balance between an instructor being flexible with deadlines, and giving students (particularly in introductory courses) too much freedom, to the detriment of your learning and your work habits.
Over the years, I have tried to strike a good balance in this course with my policies but I'd like to experiment with one tweak this year.  

For **only the Homework assignments** this year, here is the flexible grading policy I have instituted:

| Submission Time                                  | Maximum Possible Grade |
|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Before the deadline                              | 110% ^                 |
| 2 days (48 hour grace period) after the deadline | 100%                   |
| 7 days after original deadline                   | 80%                    |
| 14 days after original deadline                  | 60%                    |
| Any time before last day of classes              | 50%                    |

```{tip}
^ Note: To achieve the 110% score, you need to successfully complete **all** of the questions. You cannot earn more than 100% on the overall Homework portion, but this can help you makeup for lost marks in other missed or incomplete assignments.
```

It is important to build a rhythm as you go through undergraduate courses (particularly mine) and to do that, there is a fixed schedule that must be followed. 
Of course, deviation from the ideal schedule happens frequently in a term when students are taking other courses as well. 
That's why I have built in some "pressure releases" in this course so you have another way to manage the workload of the term.
That being said, I suggest not relying on this too much because it will set you back and if you fall too far behind, there's a danger of running out of time to catch up.

```{note}
Note: Homework assignments cannot be accepted beyond the last day of classes + 48 hours. This is non-negotiable!
