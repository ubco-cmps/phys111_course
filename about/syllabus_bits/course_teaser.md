You should take Physics 111 if you want to have some fun while also learning cool ways how our universe works.
For those of you, physics is new and alien - I welcome you to this course!
I hope to make this course as inclusive and accessible as I possibly can, and as long as you have some reasonable skills with algebra, you should be able to pick up most, if not all of the things you need to succeed in this course.
For some of you, the topics you learn may be quite familiar to you already, it will still be valuable for you to take this course and crystallize in your minds some key concepts that you thought you knew.
I believe that one of the best ways to ensure learning happens, is repeated exposure to the same content from different lenses.
So I hope that exposure to content you may already be familiar with, through a new lens will help you appreciate the content more.

We will also be watching lots of cool-physics related videos so there's also that!

To get the most out of this course, I suggest you come in with an open mind, and participate fully and willingly in the activities I have planned for you.
It may not be something you've done before, but the techniques I'll be using in my course are research-supported, and battle-tested!
