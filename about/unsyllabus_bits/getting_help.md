The best way to get personalized help in this course is to post your questions publicly on {{ FORUM_LINK }} so that other students and TAs can help.
If you would like more individualized help, you should attend the "Tutorials" and "Student Hours" we have scheduled for this course.
Students registered in their own Tutorial get priority for help by the teaching assistants (TAs), but everyone is welcome to attend Tutorials to get extra help during the scheduled times.
Outside of Tutorials, many of the course TAs will also have additional "Student Hours" where you can drop-in for one-on-one help.
These student hours will be conducted on Zoom to make it accessible to more students.
This is time that the instructors and TAs have set aside to help YOU personally!
I understand it might feel intimidating to come to Student Hours, but we are very friendly and definitely do not bite!
We would love to hear about you, what your interests are, and if you would like any career advice. 
If nobody comes to the Student Hours, we end up sitting in a Zoom room all by ourselves, all alone, and sad.

A few other notes:

- We will be using {{ FORUM_LINK }} for Announcements in this course.
- For **all** course-related questions you can reach out to the teaching team including instructors and TAs via {{ FORUM_LINK }}.
- You are encouraged to post questions publicly whenever possible so others can benefit. For private and personal issues, you can send private messages on {{ FORUM_LINK }}.
- Any student may visit the student hour for any member of the teaching team (TA or instructor)! In other words, you can go to the student hour of ANY TA, not just the one whose lab/tutorial you are registered in.
